# VMIAP

Project with Anne Ferguson-Smith's lab on variably methylated repetitive sequence. Primary results can be found in the ipython notebook file "nb_clustering_plots". Project scripts should allow for reproducibility of results from biomart datasets.

## TODO:
- Implementation of snakemake for improved reproducibility.
- Make available generated data in cloud for "out of the box" running of analysis
